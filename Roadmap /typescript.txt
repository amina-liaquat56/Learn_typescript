TypeScript Learning Roadmap

PHASE 1: Prerequisites & Fundamentals
- Master JavaScript basics: variables, functions, objects, arrays, ES6+ features, async/await.
- Understand TypeScript: benefits, installation, setup (npm install typescript, tsconfig.json), compiling .ts to .js.

PHASE 2: Core Type System
- Primitive & special types: string, number, boolean, any, unknown, void, never.
- Type annotations & inference.
- Aliases, unions (|), intersections (&), literal types.
- Interfaces: defining object shapes, extending interfaces, optional/readonly fields.

PHASE 3: Structures & OOP
- Enums, typed arrays, tuples.
- Functions: parameter & return types, default/optional parameters, overloads, this context.
- Classes: access modifiers (public/private/protected), inheritance, abstract classes, method overriding.

PHASE 4: Advanced Type Features
- Utility Types: Partial, Readonly, Pick, Omit, Record, ReturnType.
- Generics: generic functions, classes, interfaces with constraints & defaults.
- Advanced Types: type guards, discriminated unions, mapped types, conditional types, template literal types, keyof, in, as.
- Decorators.

PHASE 5: Tooling & Config
- tsconfig.json: module resolution, compiler options, strict mode, project references.
- Tooling: linting, formatting, build tools, essential packages.

PHASE 6: Build Projects & Real-World Practice
- Mini projects: typed calculators, form handlers.
- Framework integration: React, Angular, Node.js with TypeScript.
- Advanced projects: full-stack apps, libraries, open-source contributions.

PHASE 7: Stay Updated & Participate
- Follow official TypeScript roadmap for new features.
- Explore community resources, blogs, and challenges.
- Contribute to open-source TypeScript projects.
